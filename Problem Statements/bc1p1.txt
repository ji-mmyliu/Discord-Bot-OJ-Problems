Welcome to Beginner's Contest 1!
In this first problem, you are given a number "N" and
a number "M". Your job is to find the first/smallest number
GREATER THAN "N" that is a MULTIPLE of "M"

Input Specification:
First line: N
Second line: M

You may assume that 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000

Output Specification:
One integer: the first/smallest number GREATER THAN
"N" that is a MULTIPLE of "M"

Sample input 1:
17
10

Sample output 1:
20

Sample input 2:
10
5

Sample output 2:
15

For 50% of the marks, you can assume that "M" will always be 5.
