In this problem, you are given a list of N numbers.
We will define a "peak" as being a number in the 
list where that number is GREATER THAN both of
its adjacent neighbours. (This means the two numbers
on the edges will not be peaks since they do not 
have two neighbours). For example, in the 
sequence [1, 5, 2] the number 5 is a "peak" since
it is greater than both 1 and 2. However, in
[2, 3, 3, 1] there are no peaks since there are
no number in the sequence that is GREATER THAN
both its neighbours. Your task is to find the number
of such "peaks" in the list. 

Input Specification:
First line: N
Second line: The list of numbers

Output Specification:
The number of peaks in the list.

You may assume that 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000

Sample input 1:
5
2 8 9 7 10

Sample output 1:
1

Reason: Only the number 9 is a peak since
it is greater than both its neighbours 8 and 7

Sample input 2:
7
1 2 1 3 1 3 3

Sample output 2:
2
