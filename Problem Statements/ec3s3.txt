**Educational contest 3 Problem Senior 3 - A Simple Problem**
*Jimmy loves cp problems that are simple but challenging (not important but yes)*
Given an **undirected** graph with `N` nodes and `M` edges, determine the number of **distinct simple paths** that start at node `1` and end at node `N`.

Formally, a path `A` is distinct from path `B` if it satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
1) Length of path `A` is not equal to the length of path `B`
2) There exists an index `i` where node `A[i]` does not equal node `B[i]`

Just a reminder that a **simple path** does **not** contain any cycles.

**Input specification**
First line: two space-separated integers `N` (number of nodes) and `M` (number of edges)
Next `M` lines: two space-separated integers `u` and `v` indicating that there is an undirected edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`.

**Output specification**
One integer: The number of distinct simple paths that start from node `1` and end at node `N`.

**Constraints:**
For all test cases: `1 ≤ N ≤ 18`; there are no two edges joining the same two nodes, and edges will not start and end on the same node.
For 25% of the marks: `1 ≤ N ≤ 8`
For the remaining 75%: No additional constraints

**Sample input 1:**
```
5 6
1 2
1 5
2 4
2 5
3 4
4 5
```
**Sample output 1:**
```
3
```
**Reasoning:** The three paths are `[1, 5]`, `[1, 2, 5]`, and `[1, 2, 4, 5]`
