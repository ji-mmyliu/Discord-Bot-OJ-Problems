!**Educational Contest 3 Problem Senior 1 - That's Odd**
Given an array `A` of `N` numbers, find the number of distinct ordered pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `A[i] * A[j]` is an odd number. Note: only the pair of **indices** needs to be distinct, **not necessarily the numbers themselves**.

**Input Specification:**
First line: `N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200000)`
Second line: The integers in the array `(A[1], A[2], ... A[N])`

**Output Specification:**
One integer: The number of distinct ordered pairs as specified in the problem statement.

For 20% of the marks: `1 ≤ N ≤ 500`

**Sample input:**
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Sample output:**
```
1
```
**Reason:** the only pair is `(1, 3)`.
