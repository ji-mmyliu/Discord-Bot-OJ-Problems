**Educational Contest 4 Problem 1 - Clicks per second**
Allen is practicing his clicking. He clicks for `N` seconds, and you are given the number of clicks he made in each second. For each click, find his average clicks per second (cps) so far (rounded down).

**Constraints:**
For 5% of the marks, `1 ≤ N ≤ 5`
For the remaining 95%: `1 ≤ N ≤ 200000`
For all cases: the number of clicks he makes in a single second will not exceed one million.

**Input specification:**
First line: `N`
Second line: `N` space-separated integers: the number of clicks that he made in each of the `N` seconds.

**Output specification:**
`N` space-separated integers: the so-far average clicks per second (rounded down) for each second.

**Sample input:**
```
5
4 2 2 4 2
```
**Sample output:**
```
4 3 2 3 2
```
**Explanation:**
After the first click: 4 clicks in 1 second = 4 cps
After second click: 6 clicks in 2 seconds = 3 cps
After third click: 8 clicks in 3 seconds = 2.67 cps = 2 cps (round down)
(and so on...)
