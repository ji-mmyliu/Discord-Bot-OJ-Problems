A terrible new disease COWVID-19 has spread among cows worldwide! Farmer John has decided to try to quarantine his cows as soon as possible but it's too late: M of his cows are already infected! The cows do not enjoy practising social distancing, so the total number of infected cows will get multiplied by I every week. Your task is to simulate this infecting process and see how many cows are infected after N weeks.

INPUT SPECIFICATION:
First line: three numbers separated by a space: M (initial number of cows infected), I (number of cows that an infected cow spreads to every week), and N (the number of weeks to simulate)

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
One integer: the total number of cows that were infected in the course of 
N weeks at Farmer John's farm

SAMPLE INPUT:
2 3 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
18

Reasoning: 
We start off with 2 cows infected.
Week 1: 2 x 3 --> 6 total
Week 2: 6 x 3 --> 18 total

CONSTRAINTS:
For 95% of the marks: 1 ≤ M, I, N ≤ 10
For the additional 5% marks: 1 ≤ M, I ≤ 10 ; 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^18 (For this subtask, mod the answer by 10^9+7)
