**Statement**

Daniel just wanted to bug you again, so he decided to ask you another problem!

> Given an array of `N` points on the `XY` plane, answer `Q` queries in the form `A, B` which asks the question: "If there was a line segment connecting point `(0, 0)` to point `(A, B)`, how many of the `N` points would lie on the segment?".

Since Daniel is mean he asks you to write a program to solve the problem or he will make you eat poop! o_O

**Constraints**
`1 <= N, Q <= 2 * 10 ^ 5`

The coordinates of the queries and points will not exceed `1000`, and are at least `1`.

**Note: Coordinates need not be distinct.**

**Input**
The first line of input will contain `N` and `Q`.

The next `N` lines will contain `2` integers `X` and `Y` denoting that the point `(X, Y)` is part of the array.

The final `Q` lines will each contain 2 integers `X` and `Y` denoting a query.

**Output**
Output `Q` integers, on seperate lines, where the `ith` line is the answer to the `ith` query.

**Sample Input**
```
2 1
420 420
69 69
1 2
```

**Sample Output**
```
0
```
