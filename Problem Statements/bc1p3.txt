Bob's wall consists of a sequence of black or white stripes 
(0 for black and 1 for white). Bob thinks a sequence is 
"pretty" if the black and white stripes alternate perfectly. 
A single brush stroke can change one stripe from either black 
to white or white to black. Given the pattern of Bob's 
current wall, find the minimum number of brush strokes needed 
to make his wall "pretty".

Examples of pretty walls: "010101", "101"

Input Specification:
First line: Number of stipes Bob's wall has
Second line: Bob's wall pattern given as a string of 0s and 1s

Output Specification:
A single integer indicating the miniumum number of brush strokes
needed in order to make Bob's wall "pretty"

You may assume that 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000

Sample input 1:
5
01011

Sample output 1:
1

Reason: Bob can paint the last stripe to change it
to a "0" making the new sequence "01010" which is pretty.

For 30% of the marks, you may assume Bob starts out
with a completely black wall (such as "0000")
