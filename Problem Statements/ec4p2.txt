**Educational Contest 4 Problem 2 - Neat pencils**
Kyler is a very tidy student. He has a row of pencils, each with certain lengths. He wants you to mess up his row of pencils (you heard right!). Given the lengths of Kyler's row of pencils, give him a **different** ordering of his original pencils; or just print `none` if no different reordering exists.

**Constraints:**
`1 ≤ N ≤ 200000`
The lengths of the pencils will not exceed one billion.
*Note: the lengths of the pencils are not guaranteed to be unique or in sorted order.*

**Input specification:**
First line: one integer: the number of pencils in Kyler's row
Second line: the lengths of Kyler's row of pencils

**Ouput specification:**
*Any* distinct reordering of Kyler's pencils (on one line); OR `none` if no possible distinct reordering exists.

**Sample input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Sample output:**
```
4 1 5 3 2
```
