**Statement**

Daniel was bored one day so he decided to ask you a question!

> Given an array `A` of length `N`, find the number of distinct triplets `i,  j,  k (i < j < k)` such that `A[i] ^ A[j] ^ A[k]` is odd, where ^ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

**Constraints**:
`1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5`
`1 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 9`

**Input**

The first line of input will contain an integer `N`.

The final line of input will contain `N` spaced out integers denoting the array `A`.

**Output**

On 1 line print out your answer

**Sample Input**
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Sample Output**
