You are given an array of N numbers with N tasks to perform.
For each task, find the sum of the numbers from the range
[L, R] inclusive.

Input specification:
First line: N
Second line: The array of numbers separated by spaces
Next N lines: The tasks consisting of L and R separated by a space

Output specification:
For each task, print the answer for the task on separate lines.

Time limits: Python/Java - 5.5 seconds, C++ - 2.5 seconds, C - 1.5 seconds

Sample input 1:
5
5 5 3 6 7
1 3
1 4
1 1
5 5
2 4

Sample output 1:
13
19
5
7
14

Constraints:
for 35% marks: 1 ≤ N ≤ 200 - O(N ^ 2) will pass
for 65% marks: 1 ≤ N ≤ 200000 - O(N) will pass

Note: For java users, it is imperative that you print output
using PrintWriter due to the large amount of output
